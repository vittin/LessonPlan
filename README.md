# Important Note

Lesson plan was created for my school. It contains RESTfull admin panel and read-only page for students.
However, version at planlekcji.esy.es has unlocked admin account (no password) for show full functionality, so i don't response for any content which may appear there.

Students can't edit global plan. But if you want, you can locally hide uninteresting lessons. How?
It's simple - just double-click on one of them. 
After click, all usages of this lesson will be hidden.
Your preferences will be automatically save in cookie.
You can easily restore invisible lesson too (of course without clear cookies).
Click the settings icon at upper-right corner. Then you will see all hidden lesson. Clicking on any of them will restore it.

All lessons are block elements. They are immutable like Strings - if you create one, you can't edit it. Instead, you should delete this and create new one. Why? Becouse you are supported by powerfull, smart tips, typos are alomst impossible. So like in real world, you rather want to replace one lesson by another one, than editing existing one.
